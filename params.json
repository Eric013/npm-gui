The main key is to easily work with package.json and node_modules folder. Even developers who aren't familiar with task runner like Gulp and GruntJS should won't have any problems. \r\nFor now NPM-GUI contain a few modules:\r\n- dependencies manager\r\n- devDependencies manager\r\n- scripts editor\r\n- scripts builder (based on npm packages)\r\n- console based on websocket communication\r\n\r\n### How it works\r\nNPM-GUI is starting simple webserver from folder of your project. Webserver is a core, for example it: \r\n- serve GUI for browser (it is available by default on: http://localhost:1337/)\r\n- modify package.json\r\n- run commands from client side application (example: \"npm install angular --save\" when you want to add angular to your project)\r\n- pushing console logs through websocket to client side application\r\n\r\n### Another task runner?\r\nNo it's not another task runner, package manager etc. It's based on native npm mechanism to install/uninstall/search packages.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n@q-nick\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
