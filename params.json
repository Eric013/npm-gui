The main key is to easily work with package.json and node_modules folder. Even developers who aren't familiar with task runner like Gulp and GruntJS won't have any problems.\r\nFor now npm-gui contain a few modules:\r\n- dependencies manager for:\r\n    - regular packages\r\n    - development packages\r\n- tasks manager\r\n- command builder (based on npm packages)\r\n- console based on websocket communication\r\n\r\n### How it works\r\nnpm-gui is starting simple webserver from folder of your project. Webserver is a core, for example it:\r\n- serve GUI for browser (it is available by default on: http://localhost:1337/)\r\n- modify package.json\r\n- run commands from client side application (example: \"npm install angular --save\" when you want to add angular to your project)\r\n- pushing console logs through websocket to client side application\r\n\r\n### Dependencies features\r\n- shows all types of versions:\r\n    - saved in package.json,\r\n    - installed (if is different - you can save it in package.json)\r\n    - wanted (newest compatible version - you can install it and save by click)\r\n    - latest\r\n- checks nsp errors (nodesecurity.io) - currently works only for regular dependencies\r\n\r\n### Another task runner?\r\nNo it's not another task runner, package manager etc. It's based on native npm mechanism to install/uninstall/search packages.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n@q-nick\r\n",
